    <h1>objects and its internal representation in javascript</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript variables can also contain many values. Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many
        values. Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
    </p>
    <p><b>
            It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

    <h3>Creating a JavaScript Object</h3>
    <p>
        With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.<br>
        There are different ways to create new objects:
    <ul>
        <li>Create a single object, using an object literal.</li>
        <li>Create a single object, with the keyword new.</li>
        <li>Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.</li>
        <li>Create an object using Object.create().</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Using an Object Literal</h3>
    <p>
        This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object. Using an object literal, you both define and create an
        object in one statement.<br>
        An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
    </p>
    <h3>Using the JavaScript Keyword new</h3>
    <p>
        create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and then add their properties
    </p>
    <h3>JavaScript Objects are Mutable</h3>
    <p>
        Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

        If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person.
