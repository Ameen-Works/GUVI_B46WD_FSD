  <h1>Difference Between Document and Window Objects</h1>

  <p>In web development, understanding the distinction between the Document and Window objects is crucial. Let's explore their differences and functionalities.</p>

  <h2>Document Object</h2>

  <p>The <code>Document</code> object represents the web page itself and provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating its content. It encapsulates the entire HTML document, including the head, body, and all elements within. Key features of the Document object include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
    <li>Content Modification</li>
    <li>Event Handling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Window Object</h2>

  <p>The <code>Window</code> object represents the browser window or tab containing the web page. It acts as a global object and provides an interface to control various aspects of the browser window. Key features of the Window object include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Browser Manipulation</li>
    <li>Global Scope</li>
    <li>Timers and Intervals</li>
    <li>Window Navigation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Understanding the differences between the Document and Window objects is crucial for effective web development. The Document object allows for manipulation of the web page's content and structure, while the Window object provides functionalities for browser manipulation and global scope access. By utilizing these objects appropriately, developers can build dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>

  <p>Remember to explore the documentation and further examples to gain a deeper understanding of these objects and their capabilities.</p>
