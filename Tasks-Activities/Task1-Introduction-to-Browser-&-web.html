        <h1>Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2</h1>
        <h2><i>HTTP 1.1</i></h2>
        <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols and
            defines how files are to be transferred between clients and servers on the world wide web.In the earliest
            phase (HTTP/0.9), the HTTP protocol did not use headers and only transmitted plain HTML files. It was a
            one-line protocol only supporting the GET method.As the need to exchange more than just plain HTML emerged
            along with the client and server applications becoming more mature, HTTP/1.0 (between 1991-1996) introduced
            several new features.</p>
        <ul style="list-style:square;">
            <li>The concept of headers both for requests (from the client machine) as well as responses (from servers)
                was introduced. The use of headers such as GET, POST, HEAD added extended flexibility, none of which was
                possible with the earlier version.
                Version information was now included.</li>
            <li>It allowed a single request/response for every TCP connection.</li>
            <li>Status codes were used to indicate successful requests and to indicate transmission errors.</li>
            <li>The content-type header made it possible to send files other than plain HTML, including scripts and
                media.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><i>HTTP 2</i></h2>
        <p>At the beginning of 2010, Google introduced an experimental protocol, SPDY, which supported multiplexing
            (multiple requests/responses sent and received asynchronously over a single TCP connection) but as it gained
            traction IETF’s HTTP Working Group came up with HTTP/2 in 2015, which is based on the SPDY protocol.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: square;">
            <li>It introduces the concept of a server push where the server anticipates the resources that will be
                required by the client and pushes them prior to the client making requests. The client retains the
                authority to deny the server push; however, in most cases, this feature adds a lot of efficiency to the
                process.</li>
            <li>Introduces the concept of multiplexing that interleaves the requests and responses without head-of-line
                blocking and does so over a single TCP connection.</li>
            <li>It is a binary protocol i.e. only binary commands in the form of 0s and 1s are transmitted over the
                wire. The binary framing layer divides the message into frames that are segregated based on their type –
                Data or Header. This feature greatly increases efficiency in terms of security, compression and
                multiplexing.</li>
            <li>HTTP/2 uses HPACK header compression algorithm that is resilient to attacks like CRIME and utilizes
                static Huffman encoding.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href=".\blog-objects-and-its-internal-representation.html">objects and its internal representation in
                javascript</a></li>
        <h1>objects and its internal representation in javascript</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript variables can also contain many values. Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many
            values. Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
        </p>
        <p><b>
                It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
            </b></p>
        <h3>Creating a JavaScript Object</h3>
        <p>
            With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.<br>
            There are different ways to create new objects:
        <ul>
            <li>Create a single object, using an object literal.</li>
            <li>Create a single object, with the keyword new.</li>
            <li>Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.</li>
            <li>Create an object using Object.create().</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Using an Object Literal</h3>
        <p>
            This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object. Using an object literal, you both define and create
            an
            object in one statement.<br>
            An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
        </p>
        <h3>Using the JavaScript Keyword new</h3>
        <p>
            create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and then add their properties
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript Objects are Mutable</h3>
        <p>
            Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

            If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person.
        </p>
